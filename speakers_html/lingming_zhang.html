            <p><strong>Title:</strong> Software Development in the Era of Large Language Models</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude-3.5, have shown impressive performance in various downstream applications. In this talk, I will discuss the impact of modern LLMs on critical software development problems, including software testing and program repair. In addition, I will also talk about the recent trend on leveraging LLMs to fully automate end-to-end software development tasks (i.e., AI software engineers), as well as our own Agentless work, which has been used by OpenAI to showcase the real-world coding performance of its recent models.</p>
