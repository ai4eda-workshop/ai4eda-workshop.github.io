            <h3>Title: Generative AI for Black-Box Optimization: An in-Context Approach</h3>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in many science and engineering fields. In this problem, sample efficiency is crucial due to the time, money, and safety costs of conducting experiments in the real-world. In this talk, I will describe a new paradigm for sample-efficient black-box optimization (BBO) based on in-context generative modeling. Through careful studies on initialization, pretraining, and fine-tuning, we show that even in data-scare settings involving non-traditional data modalities, we can learn powerful generative surrogates for BBO that exhibit desirable behaviors in practice: few-shot learning via in-context prompting, multi-task generalization with simulated datasets, and online refinement via closed-loop optimization. Empirically, our generative surrogates can outperform long-standing approaches for BBO and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a range of experimental design benchmarks for physical and life sciences.</p>

            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Aditya Grover is an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA.
