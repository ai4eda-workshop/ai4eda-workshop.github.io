            <p>We invite researchers from both machine learning and the EDA community, as well as other related fields, to submit their original research papers. All accepted papers will be presented as posters, with four to six contributed works being selected for an oral presentation. We encourage topics related (but not limited) to the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Graph Neural Networks for performance, power, and area (PPA) prediction and optimization for all stages of EDA pipeline, including HLS, RTL/logic synthesis, and physical designs;</li>
                <li>LLM-based code analysis for PPA prediction and optimization at all stages of EDA pipeline;</li>
                <li>Multi-Modality ML models (e.g., LLM + GNN) for PPA prediction and optimization at all stages of EDA pipeline;</li>
                <li>Domain and task transfer for HLS performance prediction with new kernels and new versions of EDA tools at different stages;</li>
                <li>ML methods to optimize circuit aging and reliability;</li>
                <li>ML for design technology co-optimization (DTCO);</li>
                <li>ML for analog, mixed-signal, and RF IC designs;</li>
                <li>Reinforcement Learning for Design Space Exploration (DSE);</li>
                <li>LLM-based design generation;</li>
                <li>Active learning and design points importance sampling;</li>
                <li>AI for compiler and code transformation;</li>
                <li>Benchmark datasets.</li>
            </ul>
