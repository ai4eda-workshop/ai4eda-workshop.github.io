### Overview page

I am the organizer of the NeurIPS 2024 workshop "AI for Electronic Design". It is an academic workshop within the NeurIPS 2024 academic conference. The workshop's theme is "AI for Electronic Design". Can you help me create a website for it? I wish the website look similar to this one: "https://sites.google.com/view/infocog-neurips-2023/home?authuser=0". It should contain 4 pages: Overview, Call for Papers, Schedule, Call for Papers, and Contest. Please first help me write the HTML and CSS for the first page "overview". Below are the detailed descriptions of the "Overview" page.

On the top is a background image covering the navigation bar and the title area. The navigation bar should appear at the top right, and please make sure there is a margin to the right of the navigation bar (The margin should be the same as the main contents). Below the navigation bar is the title, "NeurIPS 2024 workshop\nAI for Electronic Design Automation\nDecember 10, 2024". The "NeurIPS 2024 workshop" should appear in the first line of the title, "AI for electronic Design Automation" should appear in the second line, and "December 10, 2024" should appear in the third line. The second line should be bigger than the first line and the third line. The title should be in white color, because the background image is dark. Below the title and the background image are the contents. In the contents region, there should be enough margin with the left border and with the right border. Except the background of the title being an image, the background of everywhere else should be white. In the contents, the text space between two lines should be 1.25x, and the font size should be at least 18px. The theme color should be dark blue. Do not only limit your creation according to my descriptions. Use your imaginations to make it more beautiful. Please also make sure that the layout can adapt to cellphone browsers.

In the "Overview" page, I want to show the following five parts of content:

(1) Introduction: for this part, do not write the title "Introduction", but directly write the following contents.

In the past few years, domain-specific accelerators (DSAs), such as Googleâ€™s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), have shown to offer significant performance and energy efficiency over general-purpose CPUs. However, DSAs require deep hardware knowledge to achieve high performance. Unfortunately, there are far fewer hardware designers than software developers. Leveraging AI techniques to further automate chip design becomes the key to meeting the need of rapid change in software development, which is also critical for democratizing hardware design and creating next-generation energy-efficient hardware. This workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners from both machine learning and EDA communities to discuss how AI can address challenges in different stages of hardware design, promoting open benchmark datasets and open discussions to revolutionize chip design. 

(2) Major Activities: for this part, please write the title "Major Activities". Then use bullet points to show the following activities.

- Call for research papers from different stages of automating chip design
- Invited speakers from both machine learning and chip design, and both industry and academia
- Panel discussions and round table discussions to shape this field
- Promoting benchmarks in chip design which are key to the success of leveraging AI technology
- Machine Learning Contest for Chip Design with High-Level Synthesis

(3) Important Dates: for this part, please write the title "Major Activities". Then use bullet points to show the following dates.

- Aug. 16 - Oct. 15, 2024: contest stage 1
- Oct. 16 - Nov. 15, 2024: contest stage 2

### Call for Papers Page

Great job! Then, let's create the second page, "Call for Papers". Please keep the same style as the "Overview" page. On the top is still the same background image covering the navigation bar and the title area. The navigation bar be the same as before, appear at the top right, and please make sure there is a margin to the right of the navigation bar. Below the navigation bar is the title, "Call for Papers". The title should be as big as "AI for electronic Design Automation" in the "Overview" page. The title should still be in white color, because the background image is dark. Below the title and the background image are the contents. In the contents region, there should be enough margin with the left border and with the right border. Except for the background of the title being an image, the background of everywhere else should be white. In the contents, the text space between two lines should be 1.25x, and the font size should be at least 18px. The theme color should be the same dark blue as the previous "Overview" page. Do not only limit your creation according to my descriptions. Use your imagination to make it more beautiful. Please also make sure that the layout can adapt to cellphone browsers.

The "Call for Papers" page contains the following two parts of content:

(1) Introduction: for this part, do not write the title "Introduction", but directly write the following contents.

We invite researchers from both machine learning and the EDA community, as well as other related fields, to submit their original research papers. All accepted papers will be presented as posters, with four to six contributed works being selected for an oral presentation. We encourage topics related (but not limited) to the following topics:

- Graph Neural Networks for performance, power, and area (PPA) prediction and optimization for all stages of EDA pipeline, including HLS, RTL/logic synthesis, and physical designs;

(2) Submission: for this part, please write the title "Submission". There are several sub-sections in this part. The title of each sub-section should not be in a separate line, it should be in the same line as that subsection. But please bold the title of each subsection. The contents are below:

- **Formatting Instructions:** We accept 6-page papers. TODO.
- **Deadline:** TBD.
- **Dual Submission Policy:** TODO.



### Contest Page

Great job! Then, let's create the third page, "Contest". Please keep the same style as the previous two pages. On the top is still the same background image covering the navigation bar and the title area. The navigation bar should be the same as before, appear at the top right, and please make sure there is a margin to the right of the navigation bar. Below the navigation bar is the title, "Machine Learning Contest for Chip Design with High-Level Synthesis". The title should be as big as "AI for electronic Design Automation" on the "Overview" page. The title should still be in white color, because the background image is dark. Below the title and the background image are the contents. In the contents region, there should be enough margin with the left border and with the right border. Except for the background of the title being an image, the background of everywhere else should be white. In the contents, the text space between two lines should be 1.25x, and the font size should be at least 18px. The theme color should be the same dark blue as the previous "Overview" page. Do not only limit your creation according to my descriptions. Use your imagination to make it more beautiful. Please also make sure that the layout can adapt to cellphone browsers.

The "Contest" page contains the following two parts of content. The first one should be in the left half, and the second one which is a picture should be in the right half.

(1) A brief introduction of the contest: Please do not show this title for this part. Only show the below words. The "Kaggle webpage" should link to "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/machine-learning-contest-for-high-level-synthesis".

Welcome to join the contest! This competition is hosted by UCLA Vastlab, UCLA DM lab, and AMD. Please see our Kaggle webpage for more details.

### Schedule Page

Great job! Finally, let's create the "Schedule" page. Please keep the same style as the previous pages. On the top is still the same background image covering the navigation bar and the title area. The navigation bar should be the same as before, appear at the top right, and please make sure there is a margin to the right of the navigation bar. Below the navigation bar is the title, "Tentative Schedule". The title should be as big as "AI for electronic Design Automation" on the "Overview" page. The title should still be in white color, because the background image is dark. Below the title and the background image are the contents. In the contents region, there should be enough margin with the left border and with the right border. Except for the background of the title being an image, the background of everywhere else should be white. In the contents, the text space between two lines should be 1.25x, and the font size should be at least 18px. The theme color should be the same dark blue as the previous "Overview" page. Do not only limit your creation according to my descriptions. Use your imagination to make it more beautiful. Please also make sure that the layout can adapt to cellphone browsers.

The "Schedule" page only contains one part of content: the schedule. The following schedule is written in the markdown table format. Please identify the correct information in this schedule. The schedule contains four sections. Please leave a small blank between each section.

### Adjustments

I found a small issue with the navigation bar on the "Contest" page. When I use a mobile phone to view it, the navigation bar overlaps with the title. Could you better adapt it to a mobile phone browser?
